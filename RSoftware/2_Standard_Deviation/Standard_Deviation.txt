# 2) Standard deviation

## (a) Without frequency

```r
x <- c(10, 12, 13, 15, 20)
sd(x)   # sample standard deviation
```

## (b) With frequency

Population-style formula: sigma = sqrt(sum(f * (x - mean_w)^2) / sum(f)).

```r
x  <- c(10, 12, 13, 15, 20)   # class values
f  <- c(2,  3,  4,  2,  1)    # frequencies

mean_w <- sum(f * x) / sum(f)
sd_freq <- sqrt(sum(f * (x - mean_w)^2) / sum(f))
sd_freq
```
