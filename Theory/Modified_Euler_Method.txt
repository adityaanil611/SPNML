# Modified Euler Method (Heun)

1. Definition / Concept Overview
	Predictor-corrector explicit trapezoid method that averages slopes at the start and an Euler-predicted end point.

2. Mathematical Formulae
	Predictor: y_tilde = y_n + h * f(t_n, y_n).
	Corrector: y_{n+1} = y_n + h / 2 * [f(t_n, y_n) + f(t_{n+1}, y_tilde)].
	Global error is O(h^2).

3. Algorithm / Step-by-Step Procedure
	(i) Perform an Euler prediction.
	(ii) Correct using the average of the start and predicted end slopes.
	(iii) Repeat for each step.

4. Advantages
	- Better accuracy than Euler while remaining simple.

5. Disadvantages / Limitations
	- Requires an extra function evaluation per step compared to Euler.

6. Applications
	- Non-stiff initial value problems where second-order accuracy is sufficient.

7. Implementation Insight (MATLAB / R)
	Similar structure to Euler but include the corrector step.

8. Example
	For y' = -2 y the method delivers much higher accuracy than Euler for the same step size.

9. Comparison (ODE Methods)

| Method | Order | Function evals per step | Stability | Pros | Cons | Typical use |
| ------ | ----- | ----------------------- | --------- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Euler | 1 | 1 | Poor (explicit) | Simplest | Low accuracy, unstable for stiff problems | Teaching, rough preview |
| Modified Euler (Heun) | 2 | 2 | Better than Euler | Easy, decent accuracy | Still explicit | Non-stiff with light compute |
| RK2 (Midpoint) | 2 | 2 | Better than Euler | Good second-order accuracy | Less accurate than RK4 | Real-time or quick sims |
| RK4 | 4 | 4 | Good for non-stiff | High accuracy vs cost | Not for stiff problems | Default non-stiff solver |
| RK4 (systems) | 4 | 4 vector evals | Same as RK4 | Works for vector ODEs | Costly for large systems | Coupled non-stiff models |

When to prefer which?
- Highest accuracy with reasonable steps on non-stiff problems: choose RK4.
- Moderate accuracy at lower cost: choose RK2 or Heun.
- Educational use or very small h: Euler.
- Stiff problems: use implicit methods (not covered here).
