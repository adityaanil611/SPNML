# Newton Raphson Method

1. Definition / Concept Overview
	Open root-finding method that uses tangent lines; converges quadratically near the root when derivatives behave well.

2. Mathematical Formulae
	Iteration: x_{k+1} = x_k - f(x_k) / f'(x_k).

3. Algorithm / Step-by-Step Procedure
	(i) Choose an initial guess x0.
	(ii) Iterate the Newton step.
	(iii) Stop when |x_{k+1} - x_k| < eps or |f(x_{k+1})| < eps.

4. Advantages
	- Quadratic convergence near the solution.
	- Very few iterations when f' is available and well behaved.

5. Disadvantages / Limitations
	- Requires the derivative f'.
	- Sensitive to the initial guess; may diverge or land on a different root.
	- Fails when f'(x) is close to zero.

6. Applications
	- Nonlinear equation solving in engineering and optimization where derivatives can be computed.

7. Implementation Insight (MATLAB / R)
	MATLAB
	function [x, it] = newton(f, df, x0, eps, maxit)
	x = x0;
	for it = 1:maxit
		 fx = f(x); dfx = df(x);
		 if abs(dfx) < eps, error('Derivative near zero'); end
		 xnew = x - fx / dfx;
		 if abs(xnew - x) < eps || abs(fx) < eps, x = xnew; return; end
		 x = xnew;
	end
	end

	R
	newton <- function(f, df, x0, eps = 1e-10, maxit = 50){
	  x <- x0
	  for(it in 1:maxit){
		 fx <- f(x); dfx <- df(x)
		 if(abs(dfx) < .Machine$double.eps) stop('Derivative near zero')
		 xnew <- x - fx / dfx
		 if(abs(xnew - x) < eps || abs(fx) < eps) return(list(root = xnew, it = it))
		 x <- xnew
	  }
	  list(root = x, it = maxit)
	}

8. Example
	For f(x) = x^3 - 2 with f'(x) = 3 x^2 and x0 = 1, the method rapidly converges to 1.2599.

9. Comparison (Root-Finding Methods)

| Method | Principle | Order | Convergence | Complexity per iteration | Stability | Advantages | Disadvantages | Typical use |
| ------ | --------- | ----- | ----------- | ------------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Bisection | Halve bracket | 1 | Linear | 1 function evaluation | Very robust | Guaranteed if sign change, error bound | Slow, needs bracket | Safe baseline, monotonic functions |
| Regula Falsi | Secant with bracket | About 1 | Often faster than bisection | 1 function evaluation (reuse endpoints) | Robust (bracketed) | Better steps than midpoint | Can stall (sticky endpoint) | When derivatives unavailable |
| Newton-Raphson | Tangent iteration | 2 near root | Quadratic local convergence | Function plus derivative evaluation | Sensitive | Very fast when good initial guess and smooth f | Needs derivative, may diverge | Fast solves with derivative access |

Discussion:
- Use bisection when a guaranteed, steady convergence is required and derivative information is unavailable.
- Prefer Regula Falsi when the function is smooth and you want faster convergence without sacrificing bracketing safety, but watch for stagnation.
- Choose Newton-Raphson when derivatives are accessible and a high-quality initial guess is available, because its quadratic convergence dramatically cuts iterations.
