# Lagrange Interpolation

1. Definition / Concept Overview
	Constructs the interpolating polynomial for arbitrarily spaced nodes using Lagrange basis polynomials.

2. Mathematical Formulae
	P(x) = sum_{i = 0}^n y_i * l_i(x), where l_i(x) = product_{j != i} (x - x_j) / (x_i - x_j).

3. Algorithm / Step-by-Step Procedure
	(i) For each i, compute l_i(x).
	(ii) Sum y_i * l_i(x) to obtain P(x).

4. Advantages
	- Works with unequal spacing of nodes.
	- No need to build difference tables.

5. Disadvantages / Limitations
	- O(n^2) work per evaluation; numerically less stable for high degree.
	- Must recompute if a new data point is added.

6. Applications
	- Irregular sampling, sparse nodes, one-off evaluations.

7. Implementation Insight (MATLAB / R)
	MATLAB
	function px = lagrange_interp(x, y, xi)
	n = length(x); px = 0;
	for i = 1:n
		 li = 1;
		 for j = 1:n
			  if j ~= i, li = li * (xi - x(j)) / (x(i) - x(j)); end
		 end
		 px = px + y(i) * li;
	end
	end

	R
	Implement with nested loops or vectorised products for each basis polynomial.

8. Example
	Interpolate at x = 1.5 using nodes {0, 1, 2} and y = {1, 2, 5}; the result is P(1.5) = 3.875.

9. Comparison (Interpolation Methods)

| Method | Node spacing | Core formula | Accuracy region | Cost | Pros | Cons | Use |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ | --------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| Newton Forward | Equal spacing | Forward differences | Near start | Build table once, evaluation cheap | Reusable series, efficient | Needs equal spacing | Start-side table data |
| Newton Backward | Equal spacing | Backward differences | Near end | Similar | Good near end | Needs equal spacing | End-side table data |
| Lagrange | Any spacing | Basis polynomials | Global | O(n^2) per evaluation | Handles unequal spacing | Recompute when adding nodes | Irregular nodes, small n |

When to prefer which?
- Equally spaced data near the start: choose Newton Forward.
- Equally spaced data near the end: choose Newton Backward.
- Unequally spaced or few points: choose Lagrange.
