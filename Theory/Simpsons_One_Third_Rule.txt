# Simpson 1/3 Rule

1. Definition / Concept Overview
	Uses quadratic interpolation over pairs of panels (requires an even number of subintervals).

2. Mathematical Formulae
	Composite rule with n even:
	Integral ≈ h / 3 * [f(x0) + 4 * sum over odd k f(xk) + 2 * sum over even k (excluding xn) f(xk) + f(xn)].
	Error: E_S = -(b - a) * h^4 * f''''(xi) / 180 for some xi in (a, b).

3. Algorithm / Step-by-Step Procedure
	(i) Choose an even n.
	(ii) Apply weights 1, 4, 2, 4, ..., 1.
	(iii) Multiply by h / 3.

4. Advantages
	- Fourth-order accuracy; excellent for smooth functions.

5. Disadvantages / Limitations
	- Requires an even number of subintervals.
	- Not ideal for highly oscillatory data.

6. Applications
	- High-accuracy integration of smooth functions.

7. Implementation Insight (MATLAB / R)
	MATLAB offers integral (adaptive) or a custom Simpson routine; R has pracma::simpson or manual implementation.

8. Example
	Integrate sin(x) from 0 to pi; Simpson with small n gives an answer close to 2.

9. Comparison (Quadrature Methods)

| Method | Approach | Order | Grid restriction | Pros | Cons | Use |
| ------ | -------- | ----- | ---------------- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| Trapezoidal | Linear segments | 2 | None | Simple, robust, works with noisy data | Low order | Quick rough integrals |
| Simpson 1/3 | Quadratic pieces | 4 | n even | High accuracy for smooth functions | Needs even n, not ideal for highly oscillatory data | Default for smooth functions |
| Simpson 3/8 | Cubic pieces | 4 | n multiple of 3 | Same order as 1/3, flexible when n divisible by 3 | Weight bookkeeping | When n is a multiple of 3 or mixing panels |

When to prefer which?
- Smooth integrands: Simpson 1/3 is the default.
- n multiple of 3: Simpson 3/8 (alone or combined with 1/3).
- Noisy or rough data, or a quick estimate: Trapezoidal.
