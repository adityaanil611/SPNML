# Newton Forward Interpolation

1. Definition / Concept Overview
	Polynomial interpolation on equally spaced nodes using forward differences; most accurate near the beginning of the table.

2. Mathematical Formulae
	With step h and nodes x0, x1, ..., define u = (x - x0) / h.
	P(x) = y0 + u * Delta y0 + u * (u - 1) / 2! * Delta^2 y0 + ...

3. Algorithm / Step-by-Step Procedure
	(i) Build the forward-difference table.
	(ii) Compute u.
	(iii) Evaluate the series up to the desired order.

4. Advantages
	- Efficient with tabulated equally spaced data.
	- Allows incremental polynomial construction.

5. Disadvantages / Limitations
	- Requires equal spacing of nodes.
	- Accuracy degrades as x moves away from x0.

6. Applications
	- Thermodynamic, aerodynamic, and signal tables with uniform spacing.

7. Implementation Insight (MATLAB / R)
	MATLAB
	function px = newton_forward(x, y, xi)
	h = x(2) - x(1); n = length(x);
	D = zeros(n, n); D(:,1) = y(:);
	for j = 2:n, D(1:n-j+1, j) = diff(D(1:n-j+1, j-1)); end
	u = (xi - x(1)) / h; px = y(1); fact = 1; uprod = 1;
	for k = 1:n-1
		 uprod = uprod * (u - (k - 1)); fact = fact * k;
		 px = px + uprod * D(1, k + 1) / fact;
	end
	end

	R
	Implement with nested loops using diff for forward differences and series evaluation.

8. Example
	Interpolate y(x) using x = {0, 1, 2, 3}. Evaluate near x0 for best accuracy.

9. Comparison (Interpolation Methods)

| Method | Node spacing | Core formula | Accuracy region | Cost | Pros | Cons | Use |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ | --------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| Newton Forward | Equal spacing | Forward differences | Near start | Build table once, evaluation cheap | Reusable series, efficient | Needs equal spacing | Start-side table data |
| Newton Backward | Equal spacing | Backward differences | Near end | Similar | Good near end | Needs equal spacing | End-side table data |
| Lagrange | Any spacing | Basis polynomials | Global | O(n^2) per evaluation | Handles unequal spacing | Recompute when adding nodes | Irregular nodes, small n |

When to prefer which?
- Equally spaced data near the start: choose Newton Forward.
- Equally spaced data near the end: choose Newton Backward.
- Unequally spaced or few points: choose Lagrange.
