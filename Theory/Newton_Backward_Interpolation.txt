# Newton Backward Interpolation

1. Definition / Concept Overview
	Uses backward differences on equally spaced nodes; most accurate near the end of the table.

2. Mathematical Formulae
	With u = (x - x_n) / h:
	P(x) = y_n + u * Nabla y_n + u * (u + 1) / 2! * Nabla^2 y_n + ...

3. Algorithm / Step-by-Step Procedure
	(i) Build the backward-difference table.
	(ii) Compute u with respect to x_n.
	(iii) Evaluate the series to the desired order.

4. Advantages
	- Accurate near x_n for equally spaced data.
	- Same computational effort as the forward form.

5. Disadvantages / Limitations
	- Requires equal spacing.
	- Accuracy drops away from the end node.

6. Applications
	- End-region interpolation in engineering tables.

7. Implementation Insight (MATLAB / R)
	Similar to the forward method but anchored at the bottom of the difference table.

8. Example
	Interpolate near the last node of an equally spaced table for best accuracy.

9. Comparison (Interpolation Methods)

| Method | Node spacing | Core formula | Accuracy region | Cost | Pros | Cons | Use |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ | --------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| Newton Forward | Equal spacing | Forward differences | Near start | Build table once, evaluation cheap | Reusable series, efficient | Needs equal spacing | Start-side table data |
| Newton Backward | Equal spacing | Backward differences | Near end | Similar | Good near end | Needs equal spacing | End-side table data |
| Lagrange | Any spacing | Basis polynomials | Global | O(n^2) per evaluation | Handles unequal spacing | Recompute when adding nodes | Irregular nodes, small n |

When to prefer which?
- Equally spaced data near the start: choose Newton Forward.
- Equally spaced data near the end: choose Newton Backward.
- Unequally spaced or few points: choose Lagrange.
