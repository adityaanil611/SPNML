# Regula Falsi Method

1. Definition / Concept Overview
	Bracketed method that uses the secant line through (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) to estimate the root more aggressively than the midpoint.

2. Mathematical Formulae
	Intersection: c = b - f(b) * (b - a) / (f(b) - f(a)).
	Update by sign test: replace the endpoint with the same sign as f(c).

3. Algorithm / Step-by-Step Procedure
	(i) Start with f(a) * f(b) < 0.
	(ii) Compute c via the false-position formula.
	(iii) Update [a, b] using the sign change.
	(iv) Stop when |f(c)| or the interval width is below tolerance.

4. Advantages
	- Typically faster than bisection.
	- Still bracketed, so retains safety.

5. Disadvantages / Limitations
	- Can stall when the function is strongly skewed and one endpoint hardly moves.
	- Convergence remains linear in the worst cases.

6. Applications
	- Useful when derivatives are unavailable but a faster bracketed method than bisection is desired.

7. Implementation Insight (MATLAB / R)
	MATLAB
	function [root, it] = regulafalsi(f, a, b, eps, maxit)
	if f(a) * f(b) > 0, error('No sign change'); end
	for it = 1:maxit
		 fa = f(a); fb = f(b);
		 c = b - fb * (b - a) / (fb - fa); fc = f(c);
		 if abs(fc) < eps, root = c; return; end
		 if fa * fc < 0, b = c; else, a = c; end
	end
	root = c;
	end

	R
	regulafalsi <- function(f, a, b, eps = 1e-8, maxit = 100){
	  if(f(a) * f(b) > 0) stop('No sign change')
	  for(it in 1:maxit){
		 fa <- f(a); fb <- f(b)
		 c <- b - fb * (b - a) / (fb - fa); fc <- f(c)
		 if(abs(fc) < eps) return(list(root = c, it = it))
		 if(fa * fc < 0) b <- c else a <- c
	  }
	  list(root = c, it = maxit)
	}

8. Example
	For f(x) = x^3 - 2 on [1, 2], this method converges faster than bisection in early iterations but may slow if one endpoint sticks.

9. Comparison (Root-Finding Methods)

| Method | Principle | Order | Convergence | Complexity per iteration | Stability | Advantages | Disadvantages | Typical use |
| ------ | --------- | ----- | ----------- | ------------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Bisection | Halve bracket | 1 | Linear | 1 function evaluation | Very robust | Guaranteed if sign change, error bound | Slow, needs bracket | Safe baseline, monotonic functions |
| Regula Falsi | Secant with bracket | About 1 | Often faster than bisection | 1 function evaluation (reuse endpoints) | Robust (bracketed) | Better steps than midpoint | Can stall (sticky endpoint) | When derivatives unavailable |
| Newton-Raphson | Tangent iteration | 2 near root | Quadratic local convergence | Function plus derivative evaluation | Sensitive | Very fast when good initial guess and smooth f | Needs derivative, may diverge | Fast solves with derivative access |

Discussion:
- Use bisection when a guaranteed, steady convergence is required and derivative information is unavailable.
- Prefer Regula Falsi when the function is smooth and you want faster convergence without sacrificing bracketing safety, but watch for stagnation.
- Choose Newton-Raphson when derivatives are accessible and a high-quality initial guess is available, because its quadratic convergence dramatically cuts iterations.
